# GameModuleManager

**Game Module Manager**
This Game Module Manager uses **Zenject** for dependency injection and an **FSM** architecture to manage game states: _Menu, Gameplay, Game Over_, and _Victory_. Each state is modular, allowing clear transitions and separation of responsibilities. Zenject integration enhances modularity and testability, creating a scalable framework for managing game states efficiently.

**Enemy Patrol AI with Behavior Tree**
The Enemy Patrol AI employs a **Behavior Tree** structure, implemented with Zenject for modular and testable dependency management. This setup allows for dynamic patrol and interaction behaviors, supporting a flexible, scalable AI system that can easily be expanded.
